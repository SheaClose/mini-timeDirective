* Now, add a property on scope called time which is equal to  ```currentTime.toString```
* If you did everything right reload your index.html page and you should see something like
```
  Hello, Tyler
  The current time is Sun Dec 07 2014 22:03:12 GMT-0700 (MST)
```
* If you don't see that, check your console and start debugging.
* Your final timeDirective.js file should look like this
```javascript
angular.module('timeApp').directive('showTime', function(){
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    template: '<div> The current time is {{time}} </div>',
    link: function(scope, element, attrs){
      var currentTime = new Date();
      scope.time = currentTime.toString();
    }
  }
});
```
